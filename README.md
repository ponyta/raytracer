# Raytracer

This is a simple Raytracer written in Rust. Originally I wanted to be able to output to a Canvas element
or something via a rust->wasm compiler, but I deicded that for now just learning Rust would be enough.
The language was much more complicated than I anticipated and I'm excited to see what it can do!

This project mostly follows the [Ray Tracing](https://www.amazon.ca/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8)
series, but in Rust.
